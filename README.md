This is a simple artillery computer written in C++ for Arma 3's ACE3 mod. You are free to copy it and use it however you wish.

The individual functions for each of the different weapon systems are contained in header files. The weather and info
display are also in header files. This allows the computer to be modular, so you can fork this repo and add whatever
system and firing data you want.
